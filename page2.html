	<h1> About My Basketball Career</h1><p>
  <h3> Accomplishments: </h3>So far I have totaled 690 points going into my senior year. As long as we have a normal season, I should easilly reach 1000 points which is a big milestone. I was runner up for player of the year my junior year. I currently am averaging 37.5 points per game in the fall league that our team is playing in.<p>
<h3> Plans For The Future:</h3>I plan to continue to play basketball throughout college. I haven't made a decision on where I'm going yet and I don't think I will know until later in the process. I originally intended to study exercise science, but now I am not decided on my major so that I can keep my options open for schools that I can attend for basketball.<p> 
<h3>Plans After College:</h3>Originally I wanted to pusue something within personal training. I still want to do that, but I feel like thats more of a side job. I am good with numbers so I might look in to something with math.<p>
